# Upstream issues

These are the behaviors of eslint-plugin-svelte 3.23.1 that this crate does not reproduce. Each
entry is a candidate issue for eslint-plugin-svelte. ESLint with svelte-eslint-parser gave the
upstream output (`oracle lint-cases`), and `svelte/compiler`'s `parse` gave the decoded values.
Each entry names the test that holds this crate's behavior.

## A mustache fix that decodes to another string (`svelte/no-useless-mustaches`)

| Input                  | Upstream fix        | Compiler reads input as | Compiler reads fix as |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| `<p>{'&amp;'}</p>`     | `<p>&amp;</p>`      | `&amp;`                 | `&`                   |
| `<p title={'&amp;'}>`  | `<p title="&amp;">` | `&amp;`                 | `&`                   |
| `<p title="x{'&lt;'}">` | `<p title="x&lt;">` | `x&lt;`                | `x<`                  |
| `<p>&am{'p;'}</p>`     | `<p>&amp;</p>`      | `&amp;`                 | `&`                   |
| `<p>{'&am'}{'p;'}</p>` | `<p>&amp;</p>`      | `&amp;`                 | `&`                   |
| `<p>{'\0'}</p>`        | `<p>0</p>`          | U+0000                  | `0`                   |

The fix writes the literal's text into markup, and markup decodes character references. A fix
should not change the value. This crate withholds such a fix and keeps the report. For a reference
split across two mustaches, it fixes only the second one.
Tests: `no_useless_mustaches::tests::a_fix_that_would_decode_differently_is_withheld` and
`a_reference_split_between_mustaches_keeps_its_first_half`.

## An option that misses `\0` (`svelte/no-useless-mustaches`)

With `[{ "ignoreStringEscape": true }]`, upstream reports `<p>{'\0'}</p>` and fixes it to `0`.
The escape list (`nrvtbfux`) leaves out `\0`, the one digit escape that strict code allows. This
crate counts `\0` as an escape and does not report it.
Test: `no_useless_mustaches::tests::a_digit_escape_is_a_string_escape`.

## A shorthand that does not compile (`svelte/shorthand-attribute`)

| Input                 | Upstream fix        | `svelte/compiler` on the fix |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `<div a={(a)}></div>` | `<div {(a)}></div>` | `attribute_empty_shorthand`  |
| `<div a={/*x*/a}>`    | `<div {/*x*/a}>`    | `attribute_empty_shorthand`  |

A shorthand holds a name and nothing else, apart from whitespace. This crate reports these
attributes and writes no fix.
Test: `shorthand_attribute::tests::a_shorthand_that_would_not_compile_is_not_written`.

## Runes mode from a rune named in some types (svelte-eslint-parser)

`hasRunesSymbol` walks the script with ESLint's visitor keys. Those keys skip an identifier's
annotation, a return type and type arguments, but they fall back to every key of a TypeScript node.
So `let o: $state;` leaves runes mode off, while each of these turns it on:

- `let o = 1 as $state;`
- `type T = $state;`
- `interface I { a: $state }`

A name in a type names no rune. This crate leaves runes mode off for these three and for the three
that upstream already skips.
Test: `runes_mode::tests::a_rune_named_in_a_type_does_not`. The own cases
`no-at-const-tags/valid/rune-names-in-types` and `no-inspect/valid/rune-name-in-a-type` hold the
half that agrees with upstream.

## A destructured name read as the whole object (`svelte/no-not-function-handler`)

`findRootExpression` follows `const { h } = { h: 1 }` to `{ h: 1 }` and reports "Unexpected
object in event handler." for `onclick={h}`. `const [h] = [1]` gets "array". Here `h` is 1. This
crate does not follow a destructured name, and reports nothing.
Test: `no_not_function_handler::tests::a_destructured_name_is_not_its_initializer`.

## A `{@const}` that the rule does not follow (`svelte/no-not-function-handler`)

`{#if 1}{@const h = 1}<button onclick={h}></button>{/if}` gets no report, because the variable's
definition is not a script `const`. A `{@const}` is as constant as a script `const`, so this crate
follows it and reports "Unexpected number value in event handler.".
Test: `no_not_function_handler::tests::a_const_tag_is_followed`.

## A value written before the modifiers (`svelte/shorthand-directive`)

With `prefer: never`, upstream fixes `<div style:color|important>` to
`<div style:color={color}|important>`. The compiler accepts that, but it reads the value as the
text `{color}|important`, so the directive loses `|important`. This crate writes
`style:color|important={color}`.
Test: `shorthand_directive::tests::the_value_goes_after_the_modifiers`.

## A slot name fix that breaks the attribute (`svelte/no-dynamic-slot-name`)

| Input                      | Upstream fix           | What breaks                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `<slot name={'a"b'} />`    | `<slot name="a"b" />`  | the inner `"` ends the value            |
| `<slot name="x{'a"b'}" />` | `<slot name="xa"b" />` | the inner `"` ends the value            |
| `<slot name=x{"a b"}y />`  | `<slot name=xa by />`  | the space makes `by` a second attribute |

This crate reports these and writes no fix.
Test: `no_dynamic_slot_name::tests::a_name_that_the_markup_cannot_hold_as_written_is_not_fixed`.

## U+2028 and U+2029 do not end a line in node locations

- Rules: `svelte/max-attributes-per-line`, `svelte/html-closing-bracket-new-line`,
  `svelte/first-attribute-linebreak`, and every rule that compares the lines of template nodes.
- Measured with eslint-plugin-svelte 3.23.1 and svelte-eslint-parser 1.10.0.
- Cause: svelte-eslint-parser's `LinesAndColumns` (`lib/context/index.js`) ends lines at `\r\n`,
  `\r` and `\n` only. ESLint's `SourceCode` also ends lines at U+2028 and U+2029, as ECMAScript
  does. A rule that compares `node.loc` lines therefore treats a tag as one line, while the same
  report's position and `sourceCode.lines` (for example in `no-trailing-spaces`) treat it as two.
- Case: `<div d="1"` U+2028 `e="2" f="3"></div>` with `svelte/max-attributes-per-line`.
  Upstream reports `'e' should be on a new line.` at 1:12, as if `d` and `e` were on one line.
  ESLint itself ends that line before `e`. Likewise, `<div` U+2028 `b="1"></div>` with
  `svelte/html-closing-bracket-new-line` reports nothing upstream, but the tag spans two lines,
  so a line break before `>` is expected.
- Correct: count node lines with ECMAScript's line terminators, as ESLint does. This crate counts
  lines once, with ECMAScript's terminators (`LineBreaks::Ecmascript`).
