## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 375c61c: fix(ssr): apply derived-read wrapping to `{@html expr}`

  On the server, `{@html expr}` skipped the dynamic-expression transforms that the
  regular `{expr}` tag runs — most importantly `wrap_derived_reads`. Since a
  `$derived` binding compiles to a getter function on the server, `{@html post.html}`
  where `post = $derived(...)` emitted `$.html(post.html)` (reading `.html` off a
  function, i.e. `undefined`) and rendered nothing. It now emits
  `$.html(post().html)`, matching the official compiler. Non-derived expressions
  and string literals are unaffected. This surfaced as empty article bodies when
  prerendering a SvelteKit site that does `{@html ...}` over a `$derived` value.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e3f5ef5: Add `parse(source, options?)` and `parseEnvelope(source, options?)` NAPI
  exports. `parse` returns the AST as a JSON string (the cross-NAPI
  analogue of the wasm-exposed `parse_svelte`); `parseEnvelope` returns a
  raw-transfer `Buffer` in a new binary format documented in
  `src/napi_raw_parse.rs` — pair it with `decodeParseEnvelope` exported
  from `@rsvelte/vite-plugin-svelte-native/parse-envelope.js` to skip
  `JSON.parse` on the JS side.

  Every template node, attribute, directive, block, `Script`, `JsComment`,
  `SourceLocation`, and all 74 `JsNode` (estree) variants get dedicated
  binary tags. `StyleSheet`, `SvelteOptions`, and directive `metadata`
  remain inline JSON behind `TAG_JSON` for now.

  `NapiParseOptions { skipExpressionLoc?: boolean }` mirrors the existing
  `ParseOptions::skip_expression_loc`; when set, the envelope flags the
  JS decoder to skip the per-`JsNode` loc bytes.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 6ac76c2: - `resolve_id` now preserves `?query` / `#hash` suffixes and handles bare `<script module>` HMR.
  - Rebuild against the bundled `@rsvelte/compiler` correctness work.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- d95f3bb: fix: port Svelte 5.55.9 follow-ups — `nullish-coallescence-omittance` SSR
  stringify omittance (upstream `a5df6616e`) and `Percentage` keyframe
  double-print (upstream `ca3f35bf7`). Class / style / innerHTML SSR paths
  and the head-element SSR / `css-keyframes-percent` print path are still
  tracked as follow-ups in the per-suite skip lists.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 4db15ed: Roll up everything that has landed on `main` since `0.3.1` / `0.1.1`.

  - compiler: track upstream Svelte `5.51.4` → `5.51.5`.
  - vite-plugin-svelte-native: NAPI bindings now disable jemalloc's
    `initial-exec` TLS model so the dylib is safe to `dlopen` from Node on
    glibc hosts.
  - svelte-check / svelte2tsx: republish to pick up the routine dependency
    refresh (`serde_json` 1.0.150, `rustc-hash` 2.1.2).
  - Release workflow now publishes via npm OIDC trusted publishing (no
    `NPM_TOKEN`), Node 22, and `npm publish --provenance` for every
    platform sub-package — every tarball ships with provenance attestation.
  - Docs: README rewritten around the OXC integration goal, with per-task
    benchmark breakdown (parser / svelte2tsx / svelte-check) mirroring
    the live `/benchmark` page.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 1153e43: test(release): patch-bump every package to validate the GitHub Actions release pipeline end-to-end

  The local one-shot `publish-all-local.sh` is the manual escape hatch; the
  intended steady-state path is `release.yml` (changesets/action + matrix
  binary builds + `pnpm publish`). This changeset bumps each of the four
  top-level packages by `patch` so we can:

  1. Watch changesets/action open the "Version Packages" PR.
  2. Merge it.
  3. Watch the release workflow build the 5-triple matrix for both
     `svelte_check` and the NAPI cdylib, stage them via
     `scripts/stage-svelte-check-binaries.mjs` /
     `scripts/stage-vps-binaries.mjs`, and publish all 14 npm packages.
  4. Confirm every `@rsvelte/*` on the registry shows the new patch version.

  `fixed` groups in `.changeset/config.json` make the 5 svelte-check
  platform packages and the 5 vps-native platform packages follow their
  main package automatically, so this changeset only names the four
  top-level packages.

  The submodule fork (`@rsvelte/vite-plugin-svelte`) lives in a separate
  repo and isn't part of this pipeline — it's published independently.
