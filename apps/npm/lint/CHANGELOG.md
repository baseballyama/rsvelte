### Patch Changes

- a44b469: fix(compiler): add a stable `@rsvelte/compiler/wasm` subpath and fix package metadata

  The published package now exposes the WebAssembly binary under a stable
  `@rsvelte/compiler/wasm` export. Previously the only way to reach the `.wasm`
  bytes (e.g. to drive `initSync` on Node) was a deep import that hard-coded the
  internal build crate's filename, so consumers broke whenever that name changed
  (`rsvelte_core_bg.wasm` → `rsvelte_lint_bg.wasm`). Import from
  `@rsvelte/compiler/wasm` instead — it stays stable across releases.

  Existing crate-named deep imports keep working (an `exports` passthrough
  preserves them), and the default `import ... from '@rsvelte/compiler'` is
  unchanged.

  Also corrects the package `description`, which had been the linter crate's text
  rather than the compiler's.

- 386f732: fix(wasm): enable reference-types in wasm-opt

  Newer rustc/LLVM can emit a second wasm table (a reference-types externref table
  alongside the funcref indirect-call table) for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, which
  `wasm-opt`'s default MVP feature set rejects with "Only 1 table definition allowed
  in MVP". Whether the extra table appears depends on the rustc version CI resolves
  that day, not on anything in this repo, so the wasm build could break without any
  change here.

  Passing `--enable-reference-types` lets wasm-opt parse and optimize it. The
  `rsvelte_fmt_wasm` artifact shrinks ~1% as a result; `rsvelte_lint`'s is byte-identical.
