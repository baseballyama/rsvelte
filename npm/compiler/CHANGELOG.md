# @rsvelte/compiler

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 34a4593: feat(capi): add C ABI bindings (`crates/rsvelte_capi`) so the rsvelte Svelte compiler can be called from any language with a C FFI

  This release introduces a parallel distribution surface: in addition to the existing NAPI-based `@rsvelte/compiler` npm package, the compiler is now also available as a stable C shared library at `crates/rsvelte_capi`. One `cdylib` + one cbindgen-generated `rsvelte.h` lets any language with a C FFI drive the same compiler — UTF-8 JSON in, UTF-8 JSON out, no per-language schema generation.

  - **Languages with smoke tests on every PR**: C, Go, Python, Ruby, Zig, PHP, Java (JDK 22+ FFM API). C++/Kotlin/Scala/.NET/Swift are trivially derivable from the same header.
  - **API**: `rsvelte_compile`, `rsvelte_compile_module`, plus `*_into` out-parameter variants for hosts that can't pass structs by value (Ruby Fiddle, certain Java/JNI setups). `rsvelte_free` / `rsvelte_free_raw` for cleanup; `rsvelte_version` for the version probe.
  - **Options shape**: identical to the existing NAPI `compile()` options (camelCase, all optional).
  - **Breaking-change guard**: the build script panics under `RSVELTE_CAPI_CHECK_HEADER=1` if the committed header drifts from cbindgen output, and 35 cargo integration tests assert the JSON envelope shape, header invariants, and observable behaviour of every documented `CompileOption`. CI runs the full matrix (Linux/macOS/Windows × 7 languages) for every PR that touches the C ABI or the compiler.

  This does not change the published `@rsvelte/compiler` npm package's runtime behaviour — it is a parallel distribution channel. The npm version is bumped so the C ABI surface appears in the next release notes.

  See `crates/rsvelte_capi/README.md` for the full API, JSON envelope shape, memory ownership rules, and per-language quick-start table.

- ccb02b2: Upgrade target Svelte to **5.52.0** and port the two SSR compiler changes that landed upstream:

  - **Dynamic component if/else hydration markers** (upstream commit `9f48e7620`): `<svelte:component>` and `<Component this={...} />` now emit `if (expr) { push('<!--[-->'); call; push('<!--]-->'); } else { push('<!--[!-->'); push('<!--]-->'); }` instead of `(expr)?.(…)` framed by empty comments. The if/else markers let hydration repair truthy↔falsy mismatches.
  - **Re-run non-render-bound deriveds on the server** (upstream commit `09c4cb508`): `let foo = $derived(expr)` is emitted as `let foo = $.derived(() => expr)` and every read of a derived binding becomes a call (`foo()`, or `foo?.()` for `var`-kind declarators). Destructured derived patterns (`let { a, b: [c] } = $derived(stuff)`) expand to a `$$derived_array`/`$$d` helper plus per-leaf `$.derived(...)` declarators that mirror the upstream `extract_paths` expansion.

  The compatibility report stays at **3,339 / 3,339 in-scope passing** with every category at 100%.

  Side fixes along the way:

  - A handful of byte-level fallbacks in the server transform's script walker were pushing `bytes[i] as char` to a `String`, which interprets a single UTF-8 continuation byte as a Latin-1 code point and corrupts non-ASCII source (`'Compté'` → `'ComptÃ©'`). All occurrences in `transform_script.rs` now step by char boundary.
  - `is_object_shorthand_position` no longer rejects a candidate when its enclosing `{` sits at byte 0 of the scanned slice — so `{ doubled }` at the start of a `wrap_derived_reads_for_template` argument is correctly expanded to `{ doubled: doubled() }` rather than the invalid `{ doubled() }`.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 4db15ed: Roll up everything that has landed on `main` since `0.3.1` / `0.1.1`.

  - compiler: track upstream Svelte `5.51.4` → `5.51.5`.
  - vite-plugin-svelte-native: NAPI bindings now disable jemalloc's
    `initial-exec` TLS model so the dylib is safe to `dlopen` from Node on
    glibc hosts.
  - svelte-check / svelte2tsx: republish to pick up the routine dependency
    refresh (`serde_json` 1.0.150, `rustc-hash` 2.1.2).
  - Release workflow now publishes via npm OIDC trusted publishing (no
    `NPM_TOKEN`), Node 22, and `npm publish --provenance` for every
    platform sub-package — every tarball ships with provenance attestation.
  - Docs: README rewritten around the OXC integration goal, with per-task
    benchmark breakdown (parser / svelte2tsx / svelte-check) mirroring
    the live `/benchmark` page.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 1153e43: test(release): patch-bump every package to validate the GitHub Actions release pipeline end-to-end

  The local one-shot `publish-all-local.sh` is the manual escape hatch; the
  intended steady-state path is `release.yml` (changesets/action + matrix
  binary builds + `pnpm publish`). This changeset bumps each of the four
  top-level packages by `patch` so we can:

  1. Watch changesets/action open the "Version Packages" PR.
  2. Merge it.
  3. Watch the release workflow build the 5-triple matrix for both
     `svelte_check` and the NAPI cdylib, stage them via
     `scripts/stage-svelte-check-binaries.mjs` /
     `scripts/stage-vps-binaries.mjs`, and publish all 14 npm packages.
  4. Confirm every `@rsvelte/*` on the registry shows the new patch version.

  `fixed` groups in `.changeset/config.json` make the 5 svelte-check
  platform packages and the 5 vps-native platform packages follow their
  main package automatically, so this changeset only names the four
  top-level packages.

  The submodule fork (`@rsvelte/vite-plugin-svelte`) lives in a separate
  repo and isn't part of this pipeline — it's published independently.
