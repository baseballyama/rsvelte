# known-failures.{client,server}.json — why each entry is accepted

The output-equality corpus compiles every source with both the official Svelte
compiler and rsvelte (CSR + SSR) and requires byte-identical output after
comparison-side normalization. The comparison is **AST-structural**
(`normalize.astEquivalent` via acorn): comment position, `${}` line-wrapping,
redundant parens, and quote style are already absorbed, so any entry here is a
**genuine structural (AST-distinct) divergence** in the generated code, not a
cosmetic one.

The ratchet (`corpus-compat.yml`) fails only on an `(id, target)` pair not in the
baseline — the lists may only shrink, never grow. Each accepted entry must be
justified in this file.

## Client (`known-failures.client.json`, 0 entries)

No accepted client-side divergences remain.

## Server (`known-failures.server.json`, 0 entries)

No accepted server-side divergences remain.

## Hard-cluster warnings for future work

Deep areas where past fixes caused wide regressions (mirror upstream exactly;
verify against the full corpus + byte-exact runtime/ssr/css suites before
landing):

- **scope.evaluate `is_defined` / `should_proxy` lattice** — widening it to drop a
  spurious `?? ''` or proxy regresses real props that need `?? ''`. svelte resolves
  via scope; a name-keyed approximation cannot represent per-site outcomes — use
  per-site (Semantic / scope-chain) resolution.
- **each-item reactivity wrapping** (function-depth `has_external_dependencies`
  check) — a prior attempt caused ~498 regressions.
- **`$derived` currying** (`yScale()(tick)`) — reverted twice; do not retry naively.
- **store/runes name-conflict resolution** — two independent sub-bugs that must land
  together and distinguish getter-vs-user-call by context.
- **CSS structural prune** (`is_structural_descendant_chain_unused`) bails on
  snippet-declared elements, `<selectedcontent>`, `:host`/`:root`/`:global`,
  functional pseudo-classes, and escaped identifiers — extend only with the
  matching upstream semantics.
