fix(compiler): emit valid JS for `$state`/`$derived` private class fields in `.svelte.(js|ts)` modules (#907)

`compileModule` produced **syntactically-invalid** JavaScript for several class-based rune-module shapes (reported against the `runed` library). The output parsed fine in isolation by `compileModule` itself — it only blew up once a bundler re-parsed it — so under Vite 8 + Rolldown, which compiles modules in parallel and aborts on the first bad file it reaches, the failing file set and the parser error text varied between runs. That *looked* like a thread-safety bug, but the per-file output was actually deterministic; the compile path holds no shared mutable state (added a concurrency stress test that compiles the real `runed` corpus across 8 threads and asserts byte-identical output).

Four deterministic codegen bugs in the line-based class-field transform, each now fixed:

- **Trailing line comment swallowed into `$.set(...)`** — `this.#x = getter(); // note` lowered to `$.set(this.#x, getter(); // note, true)` (an unterminated call). RHS extraction now stops at the top-level `;` and re-appends the `; // comment` tail.
- **Prefix-sibling field corruption** — wrapping a private-field read used a bare `str::replace`, so wrapping `#fps` rewrote the unrelated sibling `#fpsLimitOption` into `$.get(this.#fps)LimitOption`. Reads are now replaced only at a trailing word boundary.
- **Multi-line constructor RHS split** — `this.#rect = {\n …\n }` was transformed line-by-line, orphaning `this.#rect = {` from its body. Constructor statements are now grouped by bracket depth before the transform runs.
- **Server `$state` field lowered to a call** — on SSR a `$state` private field is a plain value, but `this.#x = v` was lowered to the call form `this.#x(v)` (and reads to `this.#x()`). `post_process_for_server` now distinguishes `$.derived(...)`-backed fields (callable) from `$state` fields (plain `this.#x` / `this.#x = v`).

Also fixes a spurious `constant_assignment` error (`runed/persisted-state`): a class-method body was not registered in the scope map, so a method-local `let x` that shadowed a top-level function param `x` was misresolved to the outer (constant) binding. Class-method bodies are now registered like function bodies. Closes #907.
