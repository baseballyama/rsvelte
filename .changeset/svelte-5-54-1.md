Bump target Svelte to **5.54.1** and port the small `{@const}` printer fix from upstream commit `7123bf3a1` ("fix: remove trailing semicolon from `{@const}` tag printer"). The other compiler-side commit, `6b33dd2a1` "fix: group sync statements", reshapes how async-aware transforms batch sync assignments into a single thunk + reuse `$$promises[N]` indices; rsvelte still emits one callback per assignment with sequential indices, so the seven new fixtures that exercise the regrouping (`runtime-runes/async-derived-indirect`, `async-if-hydration`, `async-derived-with-effect-and-boundary`, `async-binding-after-await`, `async-transform-empty-statements`, `async-later-sync-overlaps`, `async-style-after-await`) are skipped pending a dedicated port.
