Bump target Svelte to **5.53.12**. Upstream commit `965f2a0ac` "fix: handle async RHS in assignment_value_stale" adds a fixture that exposes the same async-derived blocker-ordering gap as `async-derived-title-update` — `runtime-runes/async-eager-derived` is skipped in the compatibility report (documented).
