Upgrade target Svelte to **5.52.0** and port the two SSR compiler changes that landed upstream:

- **Dynamic component if/else hydration markers** (upstream commit `9f48e7620`): `<svelte:component>` and `<Component this={...} />` now emit `if (expr) { push('<!--[-->'); call; push('<!--]-->'); } else { push('<!--[!-->'); push('<!--]-->'); }` instead of `(expr)?.(…)` framed by empty comments. The if/else markers let hydration repair truthy↔falsy mismatches.
- **Re-run non-render-bound deriveds on the server** (upstream commit `09c4cb508`): `let foo = $derived(expr)` is emitted as `let foo = $.derived(() => expr)` and every read of a derived binding becomes a call (`foo()`, or `foo?.()` for `var`-kind declarators). Destructured derived patterns (`let { a, b: [c] } = $derived(stuff)`) expand to a `$$derived_array`/`$$d` helper plus per-leaf `$.derived(...)` declarators that mirror the upstream `extract_paths` expansion.

The compatibility report stays at **3,339 / 3,339 in-scope passing** with every category at 100%.

Side fixes along the way:

- A handful of byte-level fallbacks in the server transform's script walker were pushing `bytes[i] as char` to a `String`, which interprets a single UTF-8 continuation byte as a Latin-1 code point and corrupts non-ASCII source (`'Compté'` → `'ComptÃ©'`). All occurrences in `transform_script.rs` now step by char boundary.
- `is_object_shorthand_position` no longer rejects a candidate when its enclosing `{` sits at byte 0 of the scanned slice — so `{ doubled }` at the start of a `wrap_derived_reads_for_template` argument is correctly expanded to `{ doubled: doubled() }` rather than the invalid `{ doubled() }`.
