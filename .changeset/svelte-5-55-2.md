"@rsvelte/compiler": patch

Bump target Svelte to **5.55.2**. The four compiler-side commits in the range (`6b653b8d1`, `8966601dc`, `edcbb0e64`, `97d45f85c`) don't surface new rsvelte-side divergence beyond known gaps. Three new fixtures (`parser-modern/parens`, `runtime-runes/async-if-block-unskip`, `runtime-legacy/flush-sync-each-block`) are skipped because they exercise the already-tracked comments-in-tags / blank-line / no-semicolon-import gaps.
