fix(svelte2tsx): wire named snippet children into component props. A named snippet passed as a direct child of a component (`<List>{#snippet row(..)}…{/snippet}</List>`) was lowered to a standalone `const row = …` inside the component block while the props object stayed empty, so TypeScript reported a false `Property 'row' is missing in type '{}' but required in type '$$ComponentProps'` for any required `Snippet` prop. The overlay now adds a `row` shorthand prop and relocates the snippet declaration to before the component block (so the reference is in scope and its `: ReturnType<import('svelte').Snippet>` return type keeps it assignable to the prop), mirroring upstream's implicit-snippet-prop behaviour. Verified with tsc: the false "missing prop" error is gone (0 errors, matching official svelte-check).
