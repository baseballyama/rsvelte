chore(deps): align all workspace `oxc` / `oxc_formatter` / `oxc_formatter_core` git deps to a single newer revision (71e489a). The split renovate bumps (#675/#676) fail CI because they move only `oxc_formatter`, leaving the ~15 other workspace `oxc` crates on the old revision — producing a duplicate `oxc_allocator` and an `E0308` mismatch. Unifying every `oxc` dep to the same revision fixes that; verified compiler-safe (compatibility report passes) and formatter-safe (all fmt fixtures pass). Step toward oxfmt parity for `<script>` formatting (refs #761).
