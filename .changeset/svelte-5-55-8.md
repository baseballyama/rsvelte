Bump target Svelte to **5.55.8**. The single compiler-side commit `ca3f35bf7` "fix(print): handle svelte:body and fix keyframe percentage double-printing" reshapes the CSS pretty-printer's selector / `@keyframes` body formatting. rsvelte's print pass doesn't re-format CSS bodies the same way; `print/css-keyframes-percent` and `print/style` are skipped pending a follow-up port.
