fix(svelte2tsx): generate balanced TSX for an `{#await}` block whose `{:catch}` has no error variable. The variable-less catch emitted one extra `}` (closing the outer block before `catch`), and the pending+then+catch shape omitted the `try {` entirely, producing invalid TSX (`'catch' or 'finally' expected`) that made `--tsgo` flag the overlay invalid and suppress all real type errors program-wide. Now mirrors upstream `handleAwait`: `try { … } catch($$_e) { … }` (#753)
