Bump target Svelte to **5.53.5** and port upstream commit `0df5abcae` "Merge commit from fork — fix: escape `innerText` and `textContent` bindings of `contenteditable`". The server transform now HTML-escapes `bind:innerText` / `bind:textContent` expressions on contenteditable elements to prevent XSS via attacker-controlled content. `bind:innerHTML` keeps its raw expression because the user is explicitly opting into HTML.
