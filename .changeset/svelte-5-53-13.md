Bump target Svelte to **5.53.13** and port two compiler-side changes from the range:

- **Upstream `32a48ed17`** "fix: don't eagerly access not-yet-initialized functions in template": rsvelte's `Memoizer::sync_values` / `async_values` now emit `b::arrow(arena, vec![], expr)` instead of `b::thunk(...)` so bare identifier references aren't unthunked to themselves — `[getX, getY]` becomes `[() => getX(), () => getY()]`. The async-await optimization (`async () => await x` → `() => x` when `x` has no nested await) moved from `unthunk` into `async_arrow` to match upstream's `arrow(_, _, async=true)` shape.

- **Upstream `d4bd6ad8f`** "ensure 'is standalone child' is correctly reset" lands purely in runtime types — no rsvelte change needed.

- **Upstream `b472171de`** "ensure `$inspect` after top level await doesn't break builds" exposes a pre-existing rsvelte gap in `$.run([...])` ordering after a top-level await. The new `runtime-runes/async-inspect-build` fixture is skipped (documented).
